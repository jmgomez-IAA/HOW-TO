<hr>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Installation</strong></font><strong>&nbsp;-
My desktop computer is a Macintosh and the program crashes</strong>:
many unzip programs for the Mac tend to corrupt the content of <em>.zip</em>
files. If you have a problem, use Stuffit Expander (free) to open
<em>metro.zip</em>.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>General</strong></font><strong>&nbsp;-
Why don't you include maps in the program?</strong> It's too much
work for us and we feel it's not essential. Please don't insist
on that matter!</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>General</strong></font><strong>&nbsp;-
The stations list show some stops twice</strong>: the line has
diverging branches from this point.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Calculation</strong></font><strong>&nbsp;-
The program tells me &quot;the station is closed on selected
time&quot; but I'm sure it's opened</strong>: did you
&quot;disable&quot; the lines that serve this stop?</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Calculation</strong></font><strong>&nbsp;-
I've asked for a route and the program says it can't be computed</strong>:
did you &quot;disable&quot; any line that could prevent the route
from being calculated? Otherwise it may be due to a start or
arrival station on a one-way section, leading to a calculation
that is too complex. Try to find the corresponding stop in the
other way and you'll get a result.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Calculation</strong></font><strong>&nbsp;-
The estimated time for the shortest route is actually longer than
that for the least connection</strong>: the program can add an
extra wait time for particularly unfrequent lines but it's not
included in the estimated time displayed. If you use the
&quot;least connection&quot; alternative you may have to wait on
a platform.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Calculation</strong></font><strong>&nbsp;-
The program takes a long time to compute a route</strong>: many
factors affect the program's speed and the PDA limited power
can't allow for miracles. You can always stop the current
calculation by &quot;tapping&quot; on the progress bar...</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Results</strong></font><strong>&nbsp;-
Directions in New York don't use local vocabulary
(&quot;uptown&quot;, downtown&quot;...)</strong>: this feature is
in development (already available in London).</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Results</strong></font><strong>&nbsp;-
Line colors appear distorted</strong>: our little devices have
limited color management abilities and there is nothing you can
do about that (neither can we ;-).</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Palm -
Installation</strong></font><strong>&nbsp;-
The program runs in a "strange" language</strong>:
You installed the wrong version of the program. Please read
carefully the <a href="MetroI-fr.html">installation
guide</a>.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Palm</strong></font><strong>&nbsp;-
The program crash on startup / when I run a calculation...</strong>:
If the first tip (about Macintosh) does not apply, it's likely
you are using and old database with a new program (or
vice-versa). In some cases, old files are not replaced when you
install new ones and the program continue to use the wrong one.
Check the cities list or, easier, completely remove the program
and the cities and re-install.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Palm</strong></font><strong>&nbsp;-
The program crash on startup / when I run a calculation...</strong>:
If the previous tip does not apply, check that you have some free
memory left on your device for the program to run. If not, try to
remove a few cities or programs you don't use anymore.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Palm</strong></font><strong>&nbsp;-
The contrast on my Palm IIIe/IIIex is very low</strong>. The
program uses a grayscale display mode and those devices are known
to handle that badly. Switch to black &amp; white only in the
options settings (and restart the program to see the difference).</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Palm</strong></font><strong>&nbsp;-
Can I install the city databases on an expansion card</strong>?
Yes it's possible but you have to copy the files in the exact
location as explained in the <a href="MetroI-en.html">installation
guide</a>.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Palm</strong></font><strong>&nbsp;-
When hotsyncing some cities, I get an error and the file is not
installed on my Palm</strong>:
Our largest files (presently Paris-full and NewYork-works) can
be installed on an external memory card only.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Palm</strong></font><strong>&nbsp;-
A message says "No city installed" on start-up</strong>:
See the item above, or read carefully the <a
href="MetroI-en.html">installation guide</a>.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Windows Mobile -
Smartphone</strong></font><strong>&nbsp;- The program has a strange
behavior</strong>: Microsoft has two different and incompatible
systems for smartphones. One is "Windows Mobile for PocketPC
Phone Edition", which requires our "PocketPC" version of MetrO,
the other is "Windows Mobile for Smartphone", for which you have
to use our "MS Smartphone" version of MetrO. Check that you have
installed the right version for your system.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Windows Mobile</strong></font><strong>&nbsp;-
Part of the main window exceeds the screen limits</strong>:
install the &quot;Regking&quot; utility (available for free from <a
href="http://www.pocketgear.com/">PocketGear</a>); run the
program; select your font; reset your device.. <em>Information
provided by V. GAKH (thanks!)</em>.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Windows Mobile</strong></font><strong>&nbsp;-
How can I have </strong><font size="4"><strong>Métro</strong>&nbsp;<img
src="Images/metro.gif" align="top" width="23" height="22"></font>
<strong>start by double-clicking on a city file</strong>? Use
&quot;Palm Tweak&quot; (or an equivalent utility) to associate
the file extension &quot;pdb&quot; to the &quot;Métro&quot;
program.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Windows Mobile</strong></font><strong>&nbsp;-
How can I change the font used in the program</strong>? Copy the
font file to the <code>windows/fonts</code> directory and select
your font in the &quot;Métro&quot; program.</p>

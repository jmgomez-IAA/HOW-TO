             *** WARNING FOR PALM USERS ***

The Paris-full databases CANNOT be installed in main memory
on PalmOS devices. You must install the files on an external
memory card, in the *right* directory (/PALM/Programs/Metro).

You can either:
- Use a card reader on your PC (or a Palm software such as
CardExport to emulate a card reader);
- Use the standard QuickInstall and hotsync tools to copy the
files to the memory card, then use a software such as FileZ
to move the files to the right folder on the card;
- Use my "Folder" utility to manage the installation through
the standard QuickInstall and hotsync tools.

See the user guide for details (guide.html or README.html in
the root directory of the zip file).

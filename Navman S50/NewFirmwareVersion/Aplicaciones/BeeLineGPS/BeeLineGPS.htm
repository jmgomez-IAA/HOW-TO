<p>Use this dialog to change the map orientation and enable/disable specific map 
details.</p>
<p>Map Tab</p>
<ul>
  <li>North Up<br>
  North Up will orient the map such that North is always up.</li>
  <li>Course Up<br>
  Course Up will orient the map such that the direction of travel is at the top 
  of the map.</li>
  <li>Waypoint Arrival Alarm Distance<br>
  Use this parameter to adjust when the waypoint arrival is triggered. This 
  applies only to a GoTo waypoint.</li>
  <li>View Navigation Window<br>
  Enables the Navigation Window on the map. The Navigation Window can show 
  navigation status such as speed, direction and distance to a GoTo waypoint.</li>
  <li>View Altitude Profile Window<br>
  The Altitude Profile Window will show the altitude graphically as time 
  progresses. </li>
  <li>Enable Position Filter<br>
  Under normal operation, this item should be checked. When in a stationary 
  position, the GPS position will wonder and the position is changing very 
  slightly. When the filter is enabled, it will take approximately a 5 meter 
  position change before a new track point is recorded and certain trip computer 
  items are updated. When the filter is disabled, every new position is recorded 
  in the track log as well as used in the trip computer.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Qualify Waypoint Averaging<br>
  Check this to qualify the position against the DOP threshold before using it 
  in the average.</li>
  <li>HDOP Threshold<br>
  Sets the HDOP threshold. BeeLineGPS will use the position if it is less than 
  or equal to this DOP value. To use positions calculated with good geometry, 
  use a numbers between 1.0 and 5.0. To use positions with relaxed geometry, use 
  numbers in the 10s and 20s.</li>

<h5><b>Active Waypoint</b></h5>
<p>Active Waypoints are waypoints that will trigger a sound file when within a
trigger distance.&nbsp; Check the &quot;Active&quot; check box to enable the
waypoint to be active. Set the trigger distance to the desired distance to
trigger the sound file. Currently only wav file are supported.</p>
<h5><b>Geocache</b></h5>
<p>The Geocache tab helps manage the waypoint as a geocache. There are several
states associated with a geocache. If the &quot;Set icon to Geocache State&quot;
is selected, then the waypoint icon will follow the geocache state. To change
the geocache state, select the state from the &quot;Geocache State&quot;
dropdown box.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE: If&nbsp; &quot;Geocache not found&quot; is selected and &quot;Set icon
to Geocache State&quot; is selected as well, the displayed icon may take on
several automatic states. These states are: &quot;New and not found&quot; and
&quot;Future cache&quot; depending on the place date on the cache.</p>
<p>The Geocache Found on parameter is designed for you to set the date that the
cache was found. If this date has never been set and you are visiting this tab
for the first time for the particular cache, then the current data is used
default.</p>

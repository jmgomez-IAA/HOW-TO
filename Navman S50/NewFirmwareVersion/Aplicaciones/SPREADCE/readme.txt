To install:
Using ActiveSync on your desktop PC open an explorer window on your P/PC.
If you don't have ActiveSync it is available (free) from www.microsoft.com .
Copy the spreadce.exe file and paste it into the \Windows\Start Menu directory on your P/PC.
Do not try to run the exe file on your desktop PC, it is not an installation program.

Installing the online help text (you don't have to install it - the program will work without it).
Installing the SCE*.htm help files into the \Windows directory on your device will allow you to call up the help text from the program at any time by pressing the Start button and then selecting the Help menu option.
(On HPC 2000, and possibly on other devices, you may need to add a shortcut to SCEHelp.htm in the \Windows\Help folder)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The program can read and write Excel 95/97 files directly, but you may instead want to store them in Pocket Excel format on your P/PC.
The Pocket Excel format takes up less space, but it is not recommended as it has fewer functions and formatting options available.

If you want to use the Pocket Excel format, set up the file conversions as follows:
Make sure that you are using ActiveSync 3.0 (available free from Microsoft's web site) to connect your desktop PC to your P/PC.
Select the ActiveSync Tools -> Options menu option,
select the Rules tab,
press the Conversion Settings button,
select the Desktop to Device tab,
select Microsoft Excel Worksheet in the listbox,
press the Edit button,
select Pocket Excel 2.0 in the drop-down list box,
and press the OK button.
Then select the Device to Desktop tab,
select Pocket Excel Workbook in the listbox,
press the Edit button,
select Excel 95 or 97 or 2000 in the drop-down listbox,
and press the OK button.

Now when you drag & drop files from the desktop computer to/from the P/PC they will be converted automatically between the Excel and Pocket Excel formats.

You will need to store the files on the P/PC in the My Documents folder, either in the main memory or on the Compact Flash memory expansion card.

<H1 STYLE="page-break-before:always">What is µBook<ibar></H1><A NAME="uBook_what"></A>

<P>µBook (MicroBook, "you"-Book, "uh"-book, you choose) is an HTML / PDB / PRC / RTF / TXT reader
that displays the data in a book-like format (commonly referred as e-Books).  
The text is divided into numerated pages like a paper book.  The viewing window 
can be of any size, which will affect the number of pages.  It remembers 
the last page read for each book, the last book read and a list of previously read
books.  Additional Annotations and Bookmarks can 
be added and reached easily.  The history of book read can 
be traversed backward or forward (like in a web browser).</P>

<P>µBook offers many <A HREF="#uBook_options">Options</A> for customisation of fonts, colours and skins.  
The display can be set to Portrait or Landscape mode, the later mostly practical on handheld devices.</P>

<P>µBook offers the possibility to change its appearance using templates called <A HREF="#options_skins">Skins</A>.
A few simple ones are distributed with µBook, but it is easy to create new skins.
See also the www.GowerPoint.com web site for some user designed skins.</P>

<P>µBook comes with <A HREF="#uBook_browser">Library</A> manager.  It lets you associate Icons and
Text Information with any file.  A classic use would be to put the Book Cover as Icon and
the Author or Version as added text.  Up to 30 pieces of text can be associated with any file. 
µBook can automatically scan and build Icons for any given Folder.</P>

<P>µBook can also decompress on the fly document in ZIP compressed archive
files.  Those files are handled the same way as directories in µBook's file Browser
document.  An <A HREF="#uBook_faq_8">external API</A> allows users/programmers to add and share input modules
for file types not handled by µBook.</P>

<P>µBook also has a <A HREF="#menu_bookmark_find">text search</A> function and generates an automatic 
<A HREF="#options_toc_criteria">Table of Contents</A> for each book that is opened.  It looks for keywords like "CHAPTER", "PART" or numerals,
including roman numerals.  The building <A HREF="#options_toc_criteria">criteria</A> can be customised.</P>

<P>µBook offers different sizes of <A HREF="#uBook_options_fonts">smooth fonts</A> with contrast adjustment to allow
a nice reading experience on CRTs and LCDs.  JPG, GIF, PNG and BMP pictures in or out of HTML, PRC and RTF documents
are handled (as well as embedded WMF bitmaps in RTF files).  Images <A HREF="#menu_image">Zooming and Panning</A> is available.
If there is an image in the same folder as the file being read that seems relevant,
it will be considered as the <A HREF="#menu_bookmark_cover">"Book Cover"</A> and shown as such.  An <A HREF="#uBook_faq_8">external API</A> for images
is also available for users/programmers to add their favourite unhandled image file format.</P>

<P>Optionally, If an image is selected, a Slide Show document of all the images
in the same Folder is displayed, one per page, starting at the page of the
selected image.  You can move around the Slide Show the same way as a normal book.</P>

<P>If you like reading without having to touch your computer (while driving for example,
although we deny suggesting this...) µBook offers an <A HREF="#menu_bookmark_as">Auto-Scrolling</A>
mode where new lines of text are added to the screen at a configurable interval, in fractional seconds or
based on your words-per-minute reading skill.</P>

<P>Hyperlinks in HTML or PRC are handled as long as the destination remains local (i.e. somewhere inside the
local computer/network, no security holes here).</P>

<P>µBook comes with a very simple <A HREF="#options_dict">dictionary</A> (based on the Webster 1913, every word
not in "Of Mice and Men" stripped out...).  Better <A HREF="#uBook_faq_9">dictionaries</A> can easily be built
or downloaded.</P>

<P>µBook caches pagination files to the local disk to allow quick reopening of books.
µBook is small and requires little resources.</P>

<H1 STYLE="page-break-before:always">Reading a book<ibar></H1><A NAME="uBook_read"></A>

<P>To open a file you must first access the <A HREF="#menu_main">File menu</A>.
There you can either go into the 
<A HREF="#menu_main_recent">Recent Files</A> sub-menu to find the most 
recently viewed files or select <A HREF="#menu_main_open">Open...</A>
to bring up a <A HREF="#uBook_browser">Browser document</A> to select a file.</P>

<P>When a document is selected for the first time, you quickly see the first
page and then you can see the page count increase as µBook pre-paginate
the book internally.  You can start reading right away, you just can't reach pages
beyond those already paginated (Note that on fast Computers, Pagination time is sometimes barely 
noticeable).</P>

<P>When the viewing window is resized, the same process takes place, but the
document isn't available until the page that was currently read (or close to it)
is reached.</P>

<P>The viewing area is divided into two sections: text and control.  Text is where the
book content appears while control is used to move around and to show page numbering.
The control part is divided into many zones.  There are "signs" for the <A HREF="#menu_main">File menu</A>,
and for the <A HREF="#menu_bookmark">Page menu</A>.  If the time is
available in the current skin, clicking on it will open the <A HREF="#menu_skins">quick-skin menu</A>, where you can
alternate between your favourite skins (i.e. if you have one for night time reading and one
for day time reading.)</P>

<P>Optionally two arrow signs are used to move <A HREF="#menu_bookmark_back_forward">Backward and Forward</A> 
in the document history, two other arrow signs are used to move between <A HREF="#menu_bookmark_ann">Annotations</A> and
two more arrow signs are used to move between Sections in
the generated <A HREF="#menu_bookmark_toc">Table of Contents</A>.  They are different depending on the skin
in use.</P>

<P>If the skin in use doesn't have the usual Windows™ border, 
there will be signs that are hot zones for Maximising or Minimising µBook 
(Or on Pocket PCs to lower or raise the window to access the Start Menu).
The page numbering is also a hot point to open
the <A HREF="#menu_content">Content menu</A>.  
Note that depending on the current text, the Content Menu might not be available.</P>

<P>The space, on either left or right of the page numbering,
is a page move zone.  Clicking once on the left will move back one page, and clicking on the right will
move forward one page. If available, a keyboard can also be used to move around a book.</P>

<P>Another way to move around the text is by using the <A HREF="#menu_bookmark_find">Text search</A> function.</P>

select your favourite skins. A quick link to the <A HREF="#options_skins">Skins Options</A> is also available.
The main use for this menu is to alternate between a nighttime and a daytime reading skin.</P>


<H1 STYLE="page-break-before:always">Browser and Library<ibar></H1><A NAME="uBook_browser"></A>
<P>The Browser is the navigator for your collection of e-books.
It displays the list of Sub-Folders, Compressed Archives, Books and Images in the current Folder.  
All are displayed as hyperlinks.  
Directly select the desired file or Folder by clicking on the appropriate link.</P>

<P>For quick access, a Section List with alphabetical index can be displayed at the top of the Browser Document.
You can Show or Hide any section by clicking on the checkbox in its header.</P>

<P>If the Library is activated, Each Entry (except Folders) can have an associated
Icon, which is a reduced version of any selected image.  Each entry can also
display user-defined piece of text (up to 30) like Author, Version, etc...</P>

<P>ZIP files can be opened through the browser, in fact they are considered
directory-like and can even be nested, i.e. ZIP inside ZIP inside ZIP...</P> 

<P>You can also add the current Folder to a list of (up to 6) favourite Folders.
They are listed at the beginning of the Folder section.  Use the <FONT IFACE=SYMBOLS>š</FONT> tag to add the Folder to the
favourites and the <FONT IFACE=SYMBOLS>ý</FONT> link to remove one from the list.</P>

<P>Options affecting the Browser and Library look and behaviour can be found at the bottom of

move to the next / previous missing icons in the current directory.</P>

<BR>

<A NAME="uBook_browser_options"></A><H2>Browser Options</H2>

<h3>Font Size</h3>
<P>Lets you select a different font size for the Browser than the one for normal reading 
(Set in the <A HREF="#uBook_options">Options Document</A>).

<h3>All or Known Type Files</h3>
<P>This forces the browser to show All Files or Known Books and Images files.</P>

<h3>Auto-Open or Ignore First Text in a Compressed Folder</h3>
<P>When active, µBook automatically opens the first text found when a compressed
folders is selected.</P>

<h3>Show or Hide File Size / Date</h3>
<P>When active, these options add an extra line below each file to show its
current size and last modification date.</P>

<h3>Enable or Disable Long File Names Mapping</h3>
<P>If long file names mapping isn't required, i.e. no files on CD-ROM are accessed, this
option should be disabled to speed-up µBook's file access.  See Map / Unmap below.</P>

<h3>Map / Unmap Long File Names</h3>
<P>This function lets you reduce filenames to 64 characters so that book collections can be easily burned onto CD-ROMs.
Filename larger than 64 characters are reduced to 56 characters plus a hash number.
A uBook.map file is created in the selected base folder (all sub-folders are done at the same time).  
The function to undo the mapping is available.  
The mapped name is invisible to µBook, which will still show the original name (as long as the uBook.map file isn't moved or destroyed).  
Note that uBook.map can also be renamed uBook.bat and executed to restore files to their original name.</P>
<P><B>Note</B> that if two map files are in the path, only the closest one to a file will be checked.</P>

<A NAME="uBook_browser_lib_options"></A><H2>Library Options</H2>
<P>Depending on the state of activation of the Current Folder, Options from
the following set will be available:</P>

<BR>

<h3>Show / Hide Library</h3>
<P>If Hidden, the Browser doesn't associate or show any Icons or Text alongside entries.
Once Shown, a Folder must be Prepared for Icons and Text to be visible.  Once prepared,
Icons are show to the left of a File and defined Text Fields are shown under it.</P>

<A NAME="uBook_lib_prep"><h3>Prepare Current Folder</h3></A>
<P>Prepare enables the Library for the current folder.  All files will be "scanned"
and the most appropriate Icon will be digitised and associated with it.  A uBook.ubi
file is created in the first writable directory found in the current path (i.e.
if inside a ZIP file, the uBook.ubi file will be created in the folder
where the ZIP file is). Once Prepared, Icons and Text can be edited.  Before
preparing, it is suggested that you check the other available options, to
set your preferences.</P>

<h3>Update / Re-Digitise or Clear Current Folder Icons</h3>
<P>Update let's you re-scan the current folder to find Icons for newly added files.
Re-Digitise will recreate the Icons.  It is useful if you have changed the original
Image file or the Size or Quality of Icons (see below).  Clear lets you disable
the Library for the current Folder.  Note that clearing will delete all Text Fields associated
with Files in this folder.</P>

<A NAME="uBook_lib_mode"><h3>Edit Icon / Edit Info / Edit All</h3></A>
<P>When Editing, available entries will be shown below the file name at the right of the Icon.</P>
<P>For Icons, they are Link and Image.  Link is the file that will be
opened if the user click on the Icon and Image is the source Image from which
the Icon was digitised.  When the Folder is first prepared, Link will be automatically
filled based on the <B>New Icons Link to File or Image</B> option below.</P>
<P>For Info, the fields are text associated with the file and (if different) the Info fields defined (see below) are shown with hyperlinks,
allowing their value to be edited.</P>
<P>You can always select the <FONT IFACE=SYMBOLS>ý</FONT> to remove or disable a field.</P>

<h3>Show / Hide Sub-Folder Icons</h3>
<P>If Sub-Folder Icons are shown, under each Folder there will be one or more
row of Icons, one for each file in the Folder.  These Icons are Shown in the Size
currently selected for the current Folder.</P>
<P>The "Save" link will let you save a text list of all the icons missing.  The file is saved in the
parent directory to the current one, with the name <I>directory</I>_missing_icons.txt.</P> 
<P>The <A HREF="#menu_np_mark">Previous / Next Mark...</A> can be used
to move through missing icons and/or sub-folders not "prepared".  
The later will have a "Prepare" link shown instead of a list of Icons.</P>

<h3>Icons Size and Quality</h3>
<P>Here you can select the Digitizing or Display size of Icons as well as the
Digitizing Quality (low quality equals small memory use, and vice-versa) of Icons.
Once an Icon has been digitise, if the Size here is changed, at display time
the Icon will be stretched or shrunk accordingly with the new Size.  Re-Digitise
(see above) can be used to apply the new Size and recreate the Icon so that no
additional stretching or shrinking is required (dynamic stretching or shrinking
is slower and can diminish the output quality).</P>

<h3>New Icons Link to File or Image</h3>
<P>Based on this settings, when a folder is <B>Prepared</B>, new Icons will be
linked with the Image used or the File it is associated with.</P>

<h3>Info Fields</h3>
<P>This lets you set a template of Editable Text Fields that can be associated with a File.</P>

<P>By painstakingly searching on the internet I found
JPG images of cover for these books, which I have then added in
the zip files.  Then I went in each Author folder and 'Prepared'
it (as a shortcut, I use 's' on the keyboard).  Note that if
an image has some keywords like 'cover' or 'front' in its
name, it will be selected before any other image file.  Once
this is done, I went back to the category folder, i.e. Crime,
and selected the Show Sub-Folders Icons option.  Since my Collection
is a bit bigger than what is shown here, I then changed the
Icon Size to in the Crime folder to be 32 by 48 instead of
64 by 96, the default.  No need to re-digitise, because the
Icons are not Hosted in the Crime Folder, but in the Author
Sub-Folder.  Now I can see my whole Crime collection at
once (well on a few pages at least).  Next I am going to
go back and for each book (using Edit Info) I will add
Version Information (1.0, 1.1 etc...) based on the Guttenberg
catalogue.</P>


<H1 STYLE="page-break-before:always">Options<ibar></H1><A NAME="uBook_options"></A>
<P>The Options Document displays the current state of options and offers alternative choices for configuration.
Select <B>Back</B> in the menu to return to the previously viewed document.</P>
<P>For quick access, a Table of Contents is displayed at the top of the Options Document.
You can Show or Hide any section by clicking on the checkbox in its header.</P>

<BR>

<A NAME="uBook_options_fonts"><h3>Font Options</h3></A>
<P>This shows the options available for µBook's font.</P>

<h3>Smooth or Sharp Fonts</h3>
<P>Let's you select between Smooth and Sharp fonts.  Smooth fonts appear rounder
and more blended while Sharp fonts, the normal Windows™ fonts, gives a better contrast 
with the background.  Note that if a Sharp font cannot be located, a smooth replacement font
will be used instead.</P>

<h4>Method</h4>
<P>Let's you select between the Grey, RGB and RGB-X engines.  If RGB or RGB-X (recommended) is selected a few more options will appear.</P>

<h4>RGB Orientation</h4>
<P>Based on your display, you should set the orientation of the RGB matrix.  Most CRTs
are Left / Right.  Most LCDs are Left / Right too except some iPaq Pocket PCs which are Up / Down.
If you use a rotation on the display, you will need to update the RGB orientation relatively.
In the case of RGB-X, only Left or Right is available, and on
some iPaq, will require <A HREF="#menu_disp_orient">Landscape</A> reading, so that Left / Right is done on the Up / Down RGB
matrix.</P>

<h4>RGB Distribution</h4>
<P>Characters outline can be improved on some display by tweaking these values.  They
defined how each RGB sub-pixel is combined with its neighbours to create the final
RGB value.  3, 2 and 1 is the default.  On Some LCDs, 5, 2 and 1 works well too.</P>
 
<h4>Lo / Med / Hi Contrast</h4>
<P>For Smooth fonts only, this let's you apply a contrast factor.  Depending on
your colour choices this can help the visual definition of fonts.  The only way
to find out is to try...</P>

<h3>Default Font</h3>
<P>Let's you select the default font for text rendering.
By clicking on the <FONT IFACE=SYMBOLS>š</FONT> or <FONT IFACE=SYMBOLS>ý</FONT> links, new font available on the local machine
can be digitised to or removed from µBook's list of fonts.</P>

<h3>Default Size</h3>
<P>Let's you select the default reading font size.  For the current selection, three more options are available:</P>

<h4>Size</h4>
<P>Let's you select the Height of the font in pixels.  In the case of Sharp and RGB-X, if the source
font isn't available on the current platform (which is the case on Pocket PCs for
the basic distribution fonts, Times, Arial and Courier), a smooth replacement font will be used 
and a warning will be visible below these Options.</P>

<h4>Bolding</h4>
<P>Let's you increase or decrease (with the little arrows) the extra bolding applied to characters of this size.</P>

<h4>Spacing</h4>
<P>Let's you increase or decrease (with the little arrows) the extra spacing between characters of this size.</P>

<BR>

<P>The <B>Sample</B> lines gives a preview of what the text looks like with the current options.</P>

<h3>Indent size is nnn Pixels or 1/mmm of Page Width.</h3>
<P>The Indent size, the space at the left of the first character of
a Paragraph, can be set here.  Either in fixed Pixel number or
relative to the page width.  Changing one will affect the other.</P>

<h3>Interline is nnn Pixels or 1/mmm of Line Height.</h3>
<P>The Interline size, the extra space between rows of characters,
can be set here.  Either in fixed Pixel number or relative to the current line height.  
The defaults are 4 pixels or 1/5 of the current line.  Changing one will
enable it, and reset the other method to its default.</P>

<BR>

<h3>Display Options</h3>
<P>This shows the options available for µBook's viewing area.</P>

<A NAME="menu_disp_orient"><h3>Portrait Up / Down or Landscape Left / Right</h3></A>
<P>This let's you change the orientation of the display.  It is mainly useful

besides it.</P>

<BR>

<h3>General Options</h3>

<h3>Run Single or Multiple instances</h3>
<P>When in Single mode, any invocation of µBook will replace the previous one.  In Multiple mode,
a second (or subsequent) window will be opened.</P>

<h3>Button N</h3>
<P>These options allow you to associate a µBook function with one of the Hardware Button
on a portable unit.</P> 

<h3>Keep Pagination, Annotations and Options for NNN Books</h3>
<P>To limit the amount of disk space used, µBook keeps information
for a limited amount of books.  This limit can be set by the user.
Note that when setting up your Library, it's possible that you will open may
files, which might mean that Annotations and Options for some older
file might be destroyed.</P>

<h3>Keep N Books in Recent Files List</h3>
<P>Lets you select between 1 and 16 to be the number of entries to keep 
in the <A HREF="#menu_main_recent">Recent Files</A> sub-menu.</P>

<h3>Enable / Disable Slide Show</h3>
<P>When Enabled, if an image is selected, a Slide Show document of all the images
in the same Folder is displayed, one per page, starting at the page of the
selected image.  You can move around the Slide Show the same way as a normal book.
When Disabled, only the selected image is shown, and no movement except "close" is available.</P>

<h3>Enable / Disable Automatic Cover Display</h3>
<P>When Enabled, if an cover exists, it will be displayed everytime a book is opened.</P>

<h3>Enable / Disable Repeated Page Turning</h3>
<P>When enabled, if the mouse button or stylus is held longer on the page move zones, the full window
becomes a sliding pad where you can move quickly in the book by moving the cursor or stylus left and right
far or near from the starting point to increase or decrease the moving speed and direction.</P>

<A NAME="options_selecting"><h3>Enable / Disable Drag Selection</h3></A>
<P>When enabled, the text selection is done in between clicking the mouse button and releasing it.
The selection is then limited to the current page.  When disabled, the selection is done with
two mouse clicks, one to select the first character and another one, anywhere
in the book, to select the end character.</P>

<h3>24 / 12 Hour Display</h3>
<P>If a clock is visible on the current skin, it will display hours based on the 24h European

<P>This Option lets you turn enable or disable the use of the ENTER key, or the
main Button on most portable units, for Auto-Scrolling.</P>

<h3>Delay between lines</h3>
<P>This Option lets you chose between two delay methods between auto-scrolled lines: Fixed or Words-per-Minute.
In Fixed mode you can enter the delay in decimal seconds, while in Words-per-Minute you can enter
your reading speed.</P>

<BR>

<h3>Book Options</h3>

<P>These Options affect the look of the currently viewed document.
Once a good set of options are defined, they can be Saved as Default, which means
that newly opened books will used these options.  Alternatively, the current book
options can be reset to the saved one by Loading Defaults.  The same process
can be done for specific File Types, by selecting the second set of Load / Save
functions (i.e. Save as HTML Defaults / Load HTML Defaults).</P>

<P>Depending on the type of document, Options are:</P>

<h3>Use Default, Plain Text or HTML parser</h3>
<P>It is possible that some PRC, HTML or other file is really formatted as a Plain Text or HTML file.
Forcing the use of the Plain Text or HTML parser should make them more readable.</P>

<h3>Ignore Font Names / Sizes / Colours</h3>
<P>By selecting one of these items, the HTML, PRC or RTF parser will ignore any font name, absolute
size or colour it finds in the text.  It allows the use of your own choices all through the text.</P>

<h3>Ignore or Use document formatting</h3>
<P>Some RTF files have formatting commands that make text look less like a book.
By ignoring those commands, the text might end-up having better margins and justification.</P>

<h3>Ignore or Use Document Line feeds</h3>
<P>Some TXT or PDB documents are already well formatted for reading.  This option allows
the turn-off of µBook "intelligent" paragraph detection algorithm.</P>

<h3>Ignore or Use MS-DOS Accented Characters</h3>
<P>Some MS-DOS formatted text use a different characters set, which causes accented
characters to show wrongly.  Turn this option on or off if that is the case.</P>

<h3>Ignore or Use *, _ and / as Bold and Italic Markers</h3>
<P>Some TXT documents uses *, _ and / as escape characters to toggle Bold and Italic
text on or off.  Turn this option on to recognise and show these styles.</P>

<h3>Ignore or Combine lines starting/ending with lower case</h3>
<P>Some RTF or TXT files, especially when they come out of an OCR program, often have
no defined paragraph but are merely a series of lines.  By turning this option on,
about 60 to 70% of those lines will be combined into paragraphs, improving the
reading enjoyment with µBook.  Note that the first few pages, which are often
title pages and table of contents, might look worse but the rest of the text
should be better.  The only way to find out is to try...</P>

<h3>Ignore or Add Extra Spacing to Italic Text</h3>
<P>Some HTML files do not have spaces between italic and normal text which
makes them harder to read.  By enabling this option, an extra space will
be inserted whenever the style changes from/to italic.</P>

<h3>Keep Intact or Add Extra Space between Paragraphs</h3>
<P>Some Documents, like Plays, read better if there is an extra space between
paragraphs.  You can use this option to force that extra space.</P>

<h3>Keep Intact or Justify Centered Paragraphs</h3>
<P>Some Documents, have faults in them which cause the text to show up
all centered.  If this is the case, turn on this option.</P>

<h3>Keep Intact / Left Align Justified Paragraphs</h3>
<P>If you don't like justified paragraphs, you can disable them with this option.
By using Left Aligned Paragraphs your eyes have to travel less.  On the
other hand Justified Paragraphs look better.  It's a matter of preferences.</P>

<BR>

<A NAME="options_toc_criteria"><h3>Table of Contents Criteria</h3></A>
<P>This section allows the customisation of criteria used to generate a book Table of
Contents.  There are Seven default criteria and a way to add more.  
Criteria are made of three parameters.  
A state ON <FONT IFACE=SYMBOLS>¯</FONT> or OFF <FONT IFACE=SYMBOLS>¬</FONT>,
a matching mode (<U>Starting with</U>, <U>Ending with</U>, <U>Containing</U> or <U>Is</U>) and the matching text.  
The Seven defaults criteria are slightly different, while the first three can be used to
match numerals (numeric, roman or textual) the last four can be used to match
any Bold, Italic, Bold-Italic or Underlined text.</P>

<P>New criteria can be added by clicking on the <FONT IFACE=SYMBOLS>š</FONT> link and they can afterward be removed
by clicking on the <FONT IFACE=SYMBOLS>ý</FONT> link on their right.</P>


<H1 STYLE="page-break-before:always">Table of Contents<ibar><BR>Annotations Summary<ibar></H1><A NAME="uBook_toc"></A>
<P>There are two ways to invoke this document, through the <A HREF="#menu_bookmark_toc">Table of Contents...</A> menu item
or the <A HREF="#menu_bookmark_ann">Annotations...</A> menu item.  Each will open the same document but in different sections.
Note that when first invoked, this document will be opened so that the initial page has information
(Table of Contents Section or an Annotation) close to the page that was viewed in the source document.</P>

<h3>Table of Contents</h3>

<P>The Table of Contents is first build automatically base on user-defined <A HREF="#options_toc_criteria">Criteria</A>.
The created table can be augmented by manually selecting text and annotating it as <A HREF="#menu_marks">Section</A>.
Alternately, from the Table of Contents, items can be removed by selecting the <FONT IFACE=SYMBOLS>ý</FONT> link on their right.</P>
<P>Each item in the Table is a link to the listed Section in the main document.</P>

<h3>Annotation Summary</h3>

<P>The Annotation section has the same presentation as the Table of Contents, but also offers a filter
to enable or disable the listing of annotations by type.  There are two ways to export this
list, either by copying the content of the PGN/uBook_books.ini file (which contains annotations
for every book) or by selecting the whole section (from the A in Annotations to the - in the last
underlighted line) and Copying it to the clipboard, then pasting it in your favourite editor.</P>


<H1 STYLE="page-break-before:always">FAQ<ibar></H1><A NAME="uBook_faq"></A>
<P>Here's some answers to common questions we are receiving:</P>

<BR>

<A NAME="uBook_faq_1"><h2>Why are some Links not working?</h2></A>
<P>The explanation is probably:</P>
<LI>The link is an external URL (i.e. on the Internet, as opposed to the local machine or network) and that is not allowed / handled by µBook.
<LI>The link refers to a file or destination that cannot be located by µBook.
<LI>The link destination is on the current page.

<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="uBook_faq_2"><h2>It crashes on this one text...</h2></A>
<P>It is possible that some text uses some form of HTML or RTF unknown to µBook and
in some case make it crash.  If it happens it would be appreciated if you
could send us a bug report with a link or zipped copy of the file (insuring first
that no copyright is violated by the distribution of such file).  Please
e-mail report to: <B>info@gowerpoint.com</B></P>

<BR>

<A NAME="uBook_faq_3"><h2>What are the PGN and PF1 directories</h2></A>
<P>The PGN directory contains pagination files for each opened text.  The
PF1 directory contains µBook font files.  
The uBook_books.ini file keeps tracks of
bookmarks, options and current page for all you books.
On the Windows™ version of µBook, if the PF2 files are deleted they will be
regenerated at the beginning of the next run.  On Pocket PC or Handheld PC they <B>SHOULD</B> not 
be deleted.  Windows™ PF2 files can be copied to Pocket PC or Handheld PC versions.</P>

<BR>

<A NAME="uBook_faq_4"><h2>Why doesn't changing font, font size or colour do anything?</h2></A>
<P>You are probably viewing an HTML or RTF files that has one or many of these
settings forced.  To override this go to the <A HREF="#menu_main_options">Options document</A>
and select to <B>Ignore</B> the item you want overridden.</P>

<BR>

<A NAME="uBook_faq_5"><h2>Where can I find free e-Books?</h2></A>
<P>Go to the www.GowerPoint.com web site.  There you will find a list of legal sources.</P>

<BR>

<A NAME="uBook_faq_6"><h2>Why can't I open this PRC or PDB file?</h2></A>
<P>µBook supports only "non-secure", "non-encrypted" PRC or PDB files.</P>

<BR>

<A NAME="uBook_faq_7"><h2>How do I make a Skin?</h2></A>
<P>All the available instructions are in SKINS/Space.usk which is a readable text file.
Note that basic programmation skills help, but are not required.</P>

<BR>

<A NAME="uBook_faq_8"><h2>How do I create an External Module?</h2></A>
<P>Go to the www.GowerPoint.com web site in the Download section and download
the sample RAR and BMP dll package.  A C compiler is required.</P>

<BR>

<A NAME="uBook_faq_9"><h2>What is the Dictionary Format?</h2></A>
<P>A dictionary is a zip file (with no subdirectories) containing:</P>
<LI>a 000.html which is a table of contents (accessible from Options... <FONT IFACE=SYMBOLS>š</FONT> Dictionary <FONT IFACE=SYMBOLS>š</FONT> (Content))
<LI>a series of XXX-YYY.html files (XXX can be changed to more or less characters)
The YYY is exclusive, while the XXX is inclusive, so the YYY of a file is the XXX
of the next one (ex. Agu-Any.html, Any-Aud.html).  Then each definition in the file
must be enclosed by a &lt;DF&gt; ... &lt;/DF&gt; pair of tags.  That's all.  You can examine
the "Webster 1913 - Small.zip" file for more details.
Note that '-' are removed from lookup word and definition word for match-up (only.)
Note also that last file must have something like "ZZZ" as YYY, so that the YYY is exclusive.
<LI>How does µBook search?  First the first (composite) word is extracted from the
selection.  Then based on the first 3 characters (or else, depending on the active dictionary)
the appropriate file is selected (i.e. if word is Ajar, the Agu-Any.html file is selected).
Then the file is quickly scanned to find the word or the closest match (i.e. the best
left substring match possible, or a word just before where the word would be in the dictionary).
The file is then opened as a document, the appropriate page is selected and the definition
selected is highlighted (using the "Find..." highlighting.)
<LI>Why multi-files instead of a big one?  For pagination sake.  Paginating a 4 meg file takes too long.

<A NAME="uBook_faq_10"><h2>COPY doesn't work!</h2></A>
<P>There seems to be inconsistency between unicode and non-unicode 
version of PPCs and HPCs.  Open uBook.ini file and locate:</P>
<P><B>CLIPBOARD_UNICODE=n</B>
<P>Where if n is 0, change it to 1 or vice-versa.</P>

<A NAME="uBook_faq_11"><h2>Why do characters look Fuzzy?</h2></A>
<P>The <A HREF="#uBook_options_fonts">RGB-X</A> settings are probably not set according to your <A HREF="#menu_disp_orient">display orientation</A>.</P>

<A NAME="uBook_faq_12"><h2>Why isn't there RAR compressed files support?</h2></A>
<P>Everything was (almost) fine until RAR 3.0. Although an awesome compression scheme, it is HEAVY on memory
for extraction (a meg at least!) plus because of some new filtering, the
byte at a time easily done with the ZIP module couldn't be reproduced with
RAR, meaning the need to decompress whole files before accessing them.  Not efficient
for portable unit with not that much speed and memory.  In comparison, the Zip module takes
less than 64k memory and can go on for megs and megs without ever needing more memory.
The uBook SDK on the web site has the source code for the RAR 2.6 and below.</P>

<A NAME="uBook_faq_13"><h2>Language support?</h2></A>
<P>µBook supports Latin-1, Western character sets.  Unicode isn't supported in this release.  There
are however a few font sets that will allow the mapping of extra characters withinh the Latin-1
range.  Links for such Cyrilic (Russian) and Polish fonts is available on the web site.</P>

		If your Pocket PC does not already have a working Internet connection, you will need to add one to run Opera. This is the connection Opera will use when you launch the browser.

		<h2 id="create">Create a GPRS Connection</h2>
		 <ol>
			<li>From the home screen, select <span class="path-menu">Start &gt; Settings &gt; Connections &gt; Connections</span>.</li>
			<li>Select "Add a new modem connection".</li>
			<li>Enter a name for the connection and select "Cellular line (GPRS)" as the modem type.</li>
			<li>Tap "Next" and under "Access point name", enter the access point information provided by your mobile operator.</li>
			<li>Tap "Next" and enter any other information provided by your mobile operator (tap "Advanced" for more options).</li>
			<li>Tap "Finish" to create the connection.</li>
			<li>Go back to "Connections" and use "Manage existing connections" to make sure the connection you just configured is set as default.</li>
		</ol>

		<p class="note">
		<strong>Note:</strong> If you are not sure about which information to enter, ask your mobile operator or refer to <a href="http://www.opera.com/connect/">www.opera.com/connect</a>.
		If your connection settings do not have the "Cellular line (GPRS)" or an equivalent option available, then you may be able to use other options to connect via a mobile phone, such as with Bluetooth or infrared, or you may be able to use your USB PC connection to connect to the Internet.

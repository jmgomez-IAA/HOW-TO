		<h2 id="open-page">Open Web Pages</h2>

		<p>
		Tap the address bar to enter or change the page address. Type in an address, and press <kbd>Return</kbd>, or tap the "Go" button to the right of the address field, to open the page.
		You can also use <span class="path-menu">Action &gt; Go to</span> to access the <a href="#bookmarks">bookmarks</a> folder, and find previously visited addresses in the history folder. To return to Opera's home page, select <span class="path-menu">Action &gt; Go to homepage</span>. "Go to" is also available from the context menu (see below).
		</p>

		<p>
		To see information about the current page, go to <span class="path-menu">Menu &gt; Tools &gt; View page info</span>.
		</p>

		<h2 id="navigate">Navigating on Web Pages</h2>

		<p>
		Opera for Pocket PC supports the use of stylus, joystick, or 5-way navigation keys (D-pad) for navigation.
		</p>

		<h3>Stylus</h3>	

		<p>
		Opera uses a stylus in the same way as most other applications for Pocket PC. Tap on buttons, menus, and text inputs to activate them.
		</p>

		<p>
		Opera also has a context menu that can be activated by tapping and holding the stylus down over the page that is being displayed.
		</p>

		<h3>Joystick and 5-way navigation keys</h3>	

		<p>
		
		Up, down, left, and right use Opera's spatial navigation to select the next link or form element in that direction. Push follows links and activates form fields.
		</p>

		<h3>Filling in forms</h3>	

		<p>
		When a form input is active, you can use any of the normal input methods to enter information. This includes the keyboard, keypad, IntelliPad, Block Recognizer, Letter Recognizer, Transcriber, or any other input method offered by your device.
		</p>

		<h3>Navigating through history</h3>	

		<p>
		As well as using "<a href="#open-page">Go to</a>" to see previously visited addresses, Opera offers several ways to navigate through history:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Tap the "Back" and "Reload" buttons on the address bar.</li>
			<li>Select <span class="path-menu">Back</span> and <span class="path-menu">Forward</span> from the context menu.</li>
			<li>Select the "Back", "Forward", or "Reload" option from the <span class="path-menu">Action</span> menu.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="downloads">Downloads</h2>

		<p>
		When you start downloading a file by clicking a link or submitting a form, it will show up in Opera's download manager. Select items in the download manager, and the menus will allow you to stop the download, retransfer it, clear it from the downloads window, delete it, or open it. Select <span class="path-menu">Close</span> or tap the close button to return to the main Opera window.
		</p>

		<p>
		From the main Opera window, you can open the download manager by going to <span class="path-menu">Menu &gt; Tools &gt; Show downloads</span>.
		</p>

		<p>
		Downloaded files are saved into <span class="path">My Device\My Documents</span>, and can be accessed using the File Explorer application.
		</p>

		<h2 id="copypaste">Copy and Paste</h2>

		<p>
		Opera supports clipboard functionality. To copy text, select it by tapping and dragging the stylus over it. Then tap and hold to activate the context menu, and select from the available options.

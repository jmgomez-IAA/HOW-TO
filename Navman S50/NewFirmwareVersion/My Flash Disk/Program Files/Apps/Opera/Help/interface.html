		<h2 id="display">Display Modes</h2>

		<p>
		Opera offers several display options that can be activated using <span class="path-menu">Menu &gt; Display</span>
		</p>

		<h3>Zoom</h3>

		<p>
		Select <span class="path-menu">Zoom in</span> and <span class="path-menu">Zoom out</span> to change the zoom of the current page. This option will scale images, text, and other page content. The zoom options are also available from the context menu.
		</p>

		<h3>Load images</h3>
		<p>
		For faster browsing and lower cost, you may choose to display only images that have already been cached locally by Opera. This setting is changed by selecting <span class="path-menu">Load images</span> from the <span class="path-menu">Display</span> menu.
		</p>

		<h3>Full-screen mode</h3>

		<p>
		Activate this mode to use the entire screen for browsing. The standard menu and title bars will not be shown in full-screen mode. To return to normal mode, use the <span class="path-menu">Full screen</span> item in the context menu.
		</p>

		<h3>Fit to screen</h3>

		<p>
		Opera's Small-Screen Rendering (SSR) technology reformats Web pages intended for desktop browsing to fit the screen of your device. This mode is on by default, and is toggled by selecting <span class="path-menu">Fit to screen</span> from the <span class="path-menu">Display</span> menu. If you switch it off, Opera will show Web pages without changing their layout.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Single column</h3>
		
		<p>
		On high-resolution screens, pages may become hard to read in portrait mode. Selecting <span class="path-menu">Menu &gt; Display &gt; Single column</span> forces a simpler rendering mode that normally will increase readability.
		</p>

		<h3>Landscape mode</h3>
		<p>
		Opera is able to run in either portrait or landscape mode, and will use whichever mode your device is using. Opera can also toggle between landscape and portrait mode when you select <span class="path-menu">Landscape</span> from the <span class="path-menu">Display</span> menu.
		</p>


		<h2 id="windows">Multiple Windows</h2>

		<p>
		Opera supports the use of multiple windows. Sometimes, these may be opened by Web pages, but you can also choose to open links in new windows by activating to context menu for the link, and selecting "<span class="path-menu">Open in new window</span>". When a new window is opened, the Tab bar will appear, with a tab for each window. Tap on the tabs to switch to that window, or tap the close button on the Tab bar to close the current window.
		</p>

		<p>
		Open or close windows by going to <span class="path-menu">Menu &gt; Windows</span>. If more than one browser window is open, switch between them by selecting <span class="path-menu">Next window</span>, or see a list of all open windows by going to <span class="path-menu">Menu &gt; Windows &gt; Windows</span>. The <span class="path-menu">Next window</span> option is also available from the context menu.
		</p>


		<h2 id="bookmarks">Managing Bookmarks</h2>
		<p>
		To bookmark a page you are viewing, go to <span class="path-menu">Action &gt; Bookmark this page</span>.
		</p>

		<p>
		Select <span class="path-menu">Menu &gt; Tools &gt; Manage bookmarks</span> to launch a bookmark editor that lets you organize your bookmarks in folders.
		</p>

		<h2 id="settings">Settings and History</h2>
		<p>
		Opera has a number of options and settings you can change according to your preferencees. To access the settings, use <span class="path-menu">Menu &gt; Tools &gt; Settings</span>
		</p>

		<p>
	The "General" tab allows you to set the home page, say how Opera should identify itself to Web sites, say if Opera should jump directly to the page content when opening a page, block pop-ups, and set the minimum font size that pages are allowed to use. <span class="note">Note:</span> Opera will only jump directly to the page content when "Fit to screen" is enabled, and the page is being displayed on a narrow screen.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you share or lend your device, you may want to erase your list of visited Web sites, and the "History" tab allows you to clear cache, cookies, and browsing history. There is also an option to specify the size of Opera's cache.
		</p>

		<p>
		The "Network" tab allows you to define proxy servers, and select which security protocols you want to enable.
		</p>

		<p>
		The remaining tab allows you to disable JavaScript and image animations, and to set Opera as your default browser. Here you can also specify to Opera the location of your keyboard, if you have one.
		</p>



		<h2 id="closing">Closing Opera</h2>
		<p>
		To close Opera, tap the close button, or select <span class="path-menu">Menu &</span>. Normally, when you close Opera, the system will maintain the process so that it starts up where you left off. If the system runs low on resources, it will automatically end the process. You can end the process manually by using the system memory management tool, or you can tell opera to close completely by using <kbd>Ctrl+Q</kbd>.

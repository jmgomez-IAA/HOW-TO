If using a stylus, click left or right of the golfer to aim. Click the golfer to swing.

The golfer's aim is indicated by a tracer that animates over the ground. When the swing begins a force meter appears and shows the current swing force.  Click again to select swing force.  If the force meter gets to the top the swing will be full force but the aim will not be accurate.

The panel at the upper left of the screen shows the current hole number, yards or feet to hole, club selected, and wind speed and direction.  Wind affects your shot so adjust accordingly.

A club is automatically selected based on the distance to the hole. If you would like to pick your own club press the 1 key. The clubs are as follows: 1W-250 (1 wood,  range about 250 yards, loft angle 12 degrees), 3W-230 (15 degrees), 3i-200 (16 degrees), 4i-185 (20 degrees), 5i-170 (24 degrees), 6i-155 (28 degrees), 7i-140 (32 degrees), 8i-125 (36 degrees), 9i-110 (40 degrees), PW-60 (wedge, 60 degrees), PT-100 (putter, range about 100 feet).

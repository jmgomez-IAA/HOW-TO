<a name="Tips"></a><b>Hints and Tips</b>
<ul>
<li>Shortcut buttons:<br>
Buttons on the command bar provide shortcuts to the following commonly used
 commands. Hint, Turn board, Board size, Take back, Take back 10 moves, Forward, Forward 10 moves and Switch sides/Move now.
<li>Take back:<br>
  This reverses a single move so has the effect of changing sides. To avoid changing sides take back twice.
<li>Clocks:<br>
The chess clocks show time as minutes:seconds or hours;minutes.  Note the ':' or ';'
 If the playing level is set to 'Game in ..' the clocks count down to show the remaining time. When time has run out '--:--' is
 displayed. If the playing level is changed mid game the clocks are set to appropriate times.
<li>Saving and Loading games:<br>
ChessGenius loads and saves games in standard PGN format which is compatible with most PC Chess playing programs.
 PGN files can be easily moved between the PocketPC and Desktop PC. One method is to choose Explore on the Microsoft ActiveSync software and drag and drop PGN files.
<li>Championship:<br>
The word "Championship" is displayed if you have not used Hint or Next best, Taken back moves or viewed the analysis. Can you beat ChessGenius without help?.

<a name="Opt"></a><b>Options</b>
<p>Choose <b>Tools -> Options..</b> or start a new game.</p>
<ul>
<li>Playing Level:<br>
Choose one of the three different types of playing level.<br>
<b>Easy</b>. ChessGenius makes deliberate mistakes on these levels. (
Beginners and children can sometimes win).<br>
<b>Time per move. </b>Choose the average time for each move.<br>
<b>Game in. </b>Choose the time for the entire game. ( The clocks count down
and you lose if you run out of time )<br>
ChessGenius plays stronger given more time to think.
<li>Players:<br>
<b>Analyze game.</b> This is like Two player but ChessGenius thinks and shows its
 thinking on the screen. Useful for playing over games.
<li>Hash size:<br>
ChessGenius uses hash tables in its searching to store data. It plays a little stronger with bigger hash 
 tables.
<li>Analysis:<br>
If On, the screen will show a line of text that shows the 'thinking process' of the computer.
 For example, the line may show:<br>
'1.03 05 cxd4 Nxd4 Nc6 Bb5' 	This means that: ChessGenius is winning by 1.03 pawns,
 Search depth = 5, and line of moves. ChessGenius is planning cxd4 and expects Nxd4 in reply etc.<br>
If set to 'Score only' the screen will show the score but not the line of moves.<br>
If set to 'On + pos count' the screen will show number of positions searched and the average number of position searched per second.<br>
<li>Fast Animation:<br>
If checked the graphic pieces move faster.
<li>Sounds:<br>
Clear this to prevent sounds when ChessGenius moves.
<li>Show legal moves:<br>
If checked ChessGenius will show legal moves. Tap on a piece to see where it can move to.
<li>Show last move:<br>
If checked ChessGenius will show the last move that it made.
<li>Tutor:<br>
If checked ChessGenius will warn if you make a weak move and give the option of taking it back. Useful for beginners.
<li>Permanent Brain:<br>
If checked ChessGenius will calculate whilst waiting for your move. ChessGenius will play stronger but battery life will be reduced.

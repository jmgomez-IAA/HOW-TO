I have successfully used them on Debian so it can be done, (including Modelsim) with patience and a bit of fiddling. The FlashPro JTAG download cable and SW tool, however, is stubbornly Windows-only, so when it comes to downloading a bitfile, I ended up borrowing a Windows machine.

Reviewing old notes, I see I had to install a few packages (from "testing", in my case)

apt-get -t testing install libmotif4:i386
apt-get -t testing install lsb-core
apt-get -t testing install libxtst6:i386

Then there were startup errors:

    Cannot register service: RPC: Authentication error; why = Client credential too weak
    Wind/U: unable to register OLE to RPC

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13111910/rpc-authentication-error
suggested the following command (which worked here but DOES have security implications) to modify these settings

echo 'OPTIONS="-w -i"' | sudo tee /etc/default/rpcbind

Then it transpires that Synplicity is supplied with startup scripts so old they pre-date 3.x kernels! The following scripts are affected...

/opt/actel/Libero_v9.1/Synplify/bin/config/platform_check
/opt/actel/Libero_v9.1/Synplify/bin/config/platform_set

Modify platform_check line 23 to read:

    2.4.* | 2.6.* | 3.2.* )

(or 3.8 in your case)
Modify platform_set line 18 to read

              2.* | 3.*)    PLATFORM=linux;

The following script is how I start the tools : it's not the whole story as far as installing them but will give pointers as to what you may need to set up, install or fix.

#!/bin/bash
# startup script for Libero
#
# Run this script as
# source /path/to/Libero.sh
# because running it as
# /path/to/Libero.sh
# will not export the environment variables...
# 
# Edit license path and hostname to suit your system!
# Note - this assumes the license file is in the same folder as the license demons.
#
HOSTNAME=xxxx
LICENSE_PATH=~/Projects/Actel/Licensing
LICENSE_DAEMON_PATH=$LICENSE_PATH
LICENSE_NAME=License2013.dat

# start the license server (in the background)
# only start it once! If the following is non-blank, 
# assume a licence server is running.
TEST= `ps ax |grep lmgrd |grep -v grep`

echo $TEST

if [ "$TEST" == "" ]; then
   echo "Starting license daemons."
   $LICENSE_DAEMON_PATH/lmgrd -c $LICENSE_PATH/$LICENSE_NAME &
else
   echo "License daemons already running."
fi

# Setup licensefile path so that Modelsim can find the correct licenses
export LM_LICENSE_FILE=$LICENSE_PATH/$LICENSE_NAME

# Synplify needs port@hostname to find its license
export SNPSLMD_LICENSE_FILE=1702@$HOSTNAME

# Setup DISPLAY so that Wind/U windows emulation works
export DISPLAY=:0

# allow Synplify to find Actel tools
export ALSDIR=/opt/actel

# on Debian, fix the famous Multilib problem again...
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu

# run this to cleanup the Wind/U registry...
/opt/actel/Libero_v9.1/Libero/bin/actel_wuclean -R

# and finally start the tools
/opt/actel/Libero_v9.1/Libero/bin/libero

Setting up HTTPS (Importante entrar siempre con https:// si se pone conexion segura.
====================

Most of these instructions are from the Arch Wiki but I will provide them here for convenience. 
Before setting up HTTPS, we need to stop the Web UI:

# systemctl stop deluge-web.service

Then we need to generate new certificates in "/srv/deluge/.config/deluge/ssl/":

# cd /srv/deluge/.config/deluge/ssl/
# openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out deluge.cert.pem -keyout deluge.key.pem

Now edit "/srv/deluge/.config/deluge/web.conf" and change the pkey and cert configuration 
directives to use your new self-signed certificates and also enable SSL:

# nano /srv/deluge/.config/deluge/web.conf

...
"pkey": "ssl/deluge.key.pem",
...
"cert": "ssl/deluge.cert.pem",
...
"https": true,

Setting up the Web UI port

This last step is a bit weird, but it happened to me that with SSL enabled 
I would only get a blank page for the Web UI. 
According to the Deluge forums a simple fix is to change the port from 8112 to 8110. 

This can also be set in the Web UI configuration file:

# nano /srv/deluge/.config/deluge/web.conf

...
"port": 8110,
...

Now the Web UI can be restarted:

# systemctl start deluge-web.service

It will be accessible at https://192.168.1.123:8110. 
Another stupid "gotcha" here is to make sure you type in the 
****************************************
"https://" in the browser's address bar. 
****************************************
If there is an autocomplete for the address in your history and you do not do this the Web UI 
will appear inaccessible because it is trying to connect over standard HTTP. Stupid, yes. 
Happens, yes.

=========================================================
Before modifying anything, stop the Deluge services:

Code: Select all
    # systemctl stop deluged.service deluge-web.service


Edit web.conf and find the line "default_daemon": "",. Add your host address between the 
quotation marks at the end:

Code: Select all
    # nano /srv/deluge/.config/deluge/web.conf

    ...
    "default_daemon": "127.0.0.1:58846",


Reboot. If everything is working well, you should be able to access the WebUI directly 
without logging into the device. In that case, you're done. Happy torrenting!



Potential issues

- If you've made sure you followed this guide properly, and you're still getting 
prompted by the Connection Manager after rebooting, stop the Deluge services and 
check the default_daemon line in web.conf again. If it's back to its default state, 
add the host address back in again, save, then run:

Code: Select all
    chmod 444 /srv/deluge/.config/deluge/web.conf

Restart the Deluge services.

- You may run into a "permission denied" error when starting a torrent if Deluge doesn't 
have write access to the download location. Try adding the user 'deluge' to the group 'root' 
by running:

Code: Select all
    # usermod -aG root deluge


Then make 'deluge' the owner of your download location:

Code: Select all
    chown deluge:root -R /srv/deluge/Downloads

Reboot.
